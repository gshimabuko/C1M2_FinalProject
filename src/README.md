 * @brief   Repository for first assignment of Introduction to Embedded Systems
 *          Software and Development Environments:
 *
 * @details This project implements functions to analyse an array of unsigned
 *          data items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean and
 *          median of the data set.
 *          There is also a recursive implementation of a sorting function based
 *          on the quicksort algorithm to order the array from largest to smallest
 *          element.
 *
 *          The implemented functions are as followed:
 *              1. main() - Main entry point for the programme;
 *              2. print_statistics() - Prints all statistics of a dataset;
 *              3. print_array() - Prints the dataset given an array and length;
 *              3. find_median() - Returns median of dataset;
 *              4. find_mean() - Returns mean of dataset;
 *              5. find_maximum - returns maximum of dataset;
 *              6. find_mininmum - returns minimum of dataset;
 *              7. sort_array - Sort array using recursive quicksort.
